## Reflection
My partner and I worked in collaboration on this lab for our project.
We were able to construct a class for parsing the user input and getting
it ready to be used by the shell. We successfully can use our shell with
a single pipe and without. Creating a child process with fork and then
setting the signals appropriately was the big new part we worked on, and
it all seems to be working well.
We still need to do more work with job control, but we have background
and foreground jobs working.
